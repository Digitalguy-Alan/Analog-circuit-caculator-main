# Analog-circuit-caculator
I have developed a comprehensive calculator designed to assist engineers in the efficient analysis of various circuit topologies. The calculator is capable of calculating the parameters of several typical circuit configurations, including voltage and current in RC circuits. Additionally, it incorporates knowledge from several areas of analog circuit analysis, including calculations related to operational amplifiers and the Fermi-Dirac equations. Furthermore, it includes a section dedicated to analog-to-digital conversion, which can be seamlessly integrated with the calculation section of digital circuits.
